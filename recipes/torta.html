    <h2><b>Ingredients:</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Torta:</b> cut in half and toasted</li>

        <li><b>Prepare the chicken.</b> Pound the chicken breast halves until thin. I like to put the chicken between two pieces<br> of plastic wrap, and use a meat mallet or a rolling pin to gently pound it thin. Dip the chicken in beaten egg and then breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li><b>Cook the chicken.</b>Cook the breaded chicken in a pan with hot oil until lightly browned on both sides, and cooked through.</li>
        <li><b>Assemble the torta.</b>Slice the ciabatta roll in half and toast it. Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise, refried beans, and <br> mashed avocado on the top piece of the roll. Layer the bottom part of the roll with the cooked chicken, cheese and peppers. Sandwich the roll together, and enjoy!</li>
